This capstone project focuses on developing a strategic pricing recommendation for MotionFreela, a subscription-based video production company. With the rapid evolution of content marketing and increased demand for high-quality video at speed, MotionFreela aims to optimize its pricing structure to scale sustainably while maintaining competitive delivery timelines.


###Methodology:

Our approach to the project was structured around four key phases:

 Data Collection
We began by gathering relevant internal and external data:
•	Internal Input: MotionFreela provided a general overview of their pricing model, turnaround times, and service offerings.
•	External Sources: We supplemented this with market research, pricing structures from various similar companies datasets on Kaggle.



Identifying Pricing Patterns
We explored:
•	How competitor pricing tiers were structured.
•	Patterns in content type (2D animation, social media reels, etc.) and delivery time.
These patterns guided the structure of our dashboard filters and helped identify relevant decision levers.

Visualization Development
Using Power BI (or Tableau, if applicable), we developed a dashboard that:
•	Lets users simulate pricing changes and visualize their potential impact on production volume and monthly revenue.
•	Includes interactive controls for video types, delivery timelines, and target customer segments.
•	Offers clear, intuitive visuals designed for non-technical decision-makers.

Recommendation Framework
Based on the analysis and insights:
•	We proposed pricing benchmarks aligned with turnaround time and complexity.
•	A documentation report accompanies the dashboard, explaining assumptions, logic, and suggested price ranges.
•	The final output is intended to assist MotionFreela in refining its pricing to balance affordability, speed, and profitability.


###Dashboard Design & Logic:

The interactive dashboard was developed as a strategic decision-support tool to help MotionFreela explore how different subscription pricing models affect projected revenue, production load, and turnaround capabilities.
A. Purpose of the Dashboard
•	Simulate and visualize the impact of changing subscription prices.
•	Allow the client to filter by video type and video duration.
•	Provide a high-level view of how different pricing tiers could affect business growth and resource allocation.

B. Key Features
•	Price Filter: Adjust subscription fee to see projected monthly revenue.
•	Video Type Selector: Switch between service types (e.g., explainer, social media, ads).
•	Revenue Forecast Chart: Displays total projected revenue under each scenario.
•	Production Volume Table: Estimates how many videos are expected per pricing tier and delivery model.

C. Data Sources & Logic
•	Base data was built using a combined dataset from various sources from Kaggle, aligned with client-provided info and external industry benchmarks.
•	Visuals were created to be easily interpreted by business decision-makers with minimal technical knowledge.

D. Outcome
The dashboard empowers MotionFreela to:
•	Experiment with different pricing strategies in a controlled environment
•	Evaluate the trade-offs between pricing, delivery time, and output volume
•	Support internal discussions and decision-making with clear visuals
